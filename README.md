**Compound Design Pattern**

This project is an example of a compound design pattern inspired by the "Head First Design Patterns" book. In this example, multiple design patterns have been combined to make the design and implementation of complex systems more modular and manageable.

**Applied Patterns:**

**1. Factory Pattern**
   
Enables the creation of new objects and allows this object creation logic to be moved to subclasses. This pattern abstracts the logic of object creation and prevents client classes from deciding which object to create.

**3. Adapter Pattern**

Facilitates the collaboration of classes with different interfaces. This pattern adapts the interface of a class to fit the interface expected by the client.

**4. Iterator Pattern**

Provides sequential access to the elements of a collection object and does not reveal the underlying structure of the collection to the client. Thus, if the collection structure changes, there's no need to modify the client code.

**6. Observer Pattern**
   
Establishes a relationship between objects so that when the state of one object changes, other objects are automatically notified. This pattern is useful when many objects need to monitor a state and prevents these objects from tightly coupling with each other.

**8. Decorator Pattern**
   
Used to dynamically extend the behavior of an object. This pattern allows adding additional functionality to an object without modifying its underlying behavior. Thus, it enables adding new behaviors to a class without changing the class itself.

This compound design pattern provides flexibility to adapt to different requirements of a project and enhances the maintainability of the design.
